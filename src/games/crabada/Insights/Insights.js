        1/ Major improvements in the @PlayCrabada economy! <br />
        <br />

        emission, likely due to more crabs either looting or renting. <br />

        stabilized <br />
        B) Both marketplace and tavern fees were higher, potentially pointing to
        increase in activity C) TUS holder count growth accelerated!

        As promised, I've pulled together the latest on the @PlayCrabada economy
        as well as an ROI guide. To start, let's look at $TUS inflation: <br />
        <br />
        A) Net inflation is flat at 0.5% compared to 2/20. Both emission and
        breeding are steady (surprisingly) <br />
        B) Marketplace activity has declined

        1/ As promised, a summarized comparison of @PlayCrabada and
        @AxieInfinity .<br />
        <br />
        In this thread I will cover gameplay, tokenomics, ROI impact and the
        teams. <br />
        This is my high level view and is not meant to be a comprehensive
        coverage.
